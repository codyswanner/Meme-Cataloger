## The Meme Cataloger!

This is a project I am working on by myself with the goals of (1) creating something I want to use and (2) challening myself/learning more about programming.  I am using ReactJS as the frontend and Python Django as the backend.
In terms of usability, the eventual goal of this project is for it to replace Google Photos as my place to store silly/funny internet media that I've saved, and for this project to have a better system for organizing and quickly finding my saved media.
In terms of programming experience, I would love for this project to be a showcase of what I can do in React and Python for potential employment opportunities, but the more realistic goal for me right now is simply to encounter real-world problems to spark reserach and learning.

### Some things I've learned so far:
 1. React!  This project originally kicked off when a friend wanted to start working on a projet to learn React.  He moved on to other things, but because I had personal motivation for this project to exist and get to a usable state, I continued working on it and learning more about React/JavaScript.
 2. WebSockets: I didn't know anything about websockets before starting this project, but it is now an integral part of this project (to the point that the one feature I coded with HTTP requests to challenge myself, uploading a new image, I am likely to move to websockets after all.  It's just so much easier and cleaner on both the frontend and backend!)
  I am using the Channels python package for running my websockets infrastructure: [Channels](channels.readthedocs.io)
 4. Material UI: A suggestion by the friend who wanted to start working in React, and has been a lifesaver in terms of quickly assembling components that look much better than I deserve to look.  [Material UI](mui.com/material-ui/)
 5. VSCode tasks: another one that I didn't know about that has significantly reduced the friction for starting a coding session.  [VS Code Tasks](code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks)
 6. Conventional Commits: At the time of writing (March 2024) I've just started trying to use this; I imagine if I ever bring anyone else in on this project (or code professionally) being familiar with this standard will be very helpful.  Or, who knows, maybe I will find it helpful even running a project by myself! [Conventional Commits](conventionalcommits.org)
 7. Various features in Django: I have worked in Django prior to this project (and LOVE it, [Django's documentation](docs.djangoproject.com), as far as I am concerned, is the gold standard of what all documentation should be like), but I have learned so much more during this project, like how to specify a media folder, how to run ASGI in Django, how to get Django and React to play nice together, how to set up and work with foreign key relations in Django's models system, how to expose database information through an API, how to store user-uploaded files... And every time I hit a situation that calls for learning more Django I get so excited to return to their docs.  [Django Docs](docs.djangoproject.com)

Some next things I want to learn are user maintenance/authorization, since the current state of the project has a single test user, and if I'm going to share this with friends (or someday sell subscriptions, if I really do start beating Google Photos at the organization and photo search game) then proper user maintenance will be key.  It's something I'm already reading up on, but if you're reading this and have tips/resources/wisdom or would like to contribute directly, I'd gladly accept any help offered! :)
I'm also currently working on systematizing my processes a little more, so that it's easier to move between systems (e.g., desktop to laptop), as well as spend less time troubleshooting issues I've already solved, keep the project in a working state more of the time, and make settting up on a new system as simple as "npm install & pip install -r requirements.txt".
